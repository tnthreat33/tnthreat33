### Hi I'm Rachel üëã

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer who graduated from Flatiron School. I have experience in JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails, with my current focus on Python. 

My professional background is in sports business and client relationships, and I currently work with Indy Eleven Sports and Entertainment. My passion lies in leveraging technology to enhance fan experiences through partnerships with sports organizations. 

When I'm not coding, you'll often hear me talking about University of Tennessee athletics, sharing travel stories, and advocating for women's sports.
