### 👋 Hey I'm Rachel 🏀✈️

I'm a Full Stack Software Developer and a graduate of Flatiron School, with a professional focus on .NET Web API and Blazor. Before transitioning to software development, I built a career in sports marketing and partnerships. My passion lies in combining a strong foundation in software development with my sports background, leveraging technology to enhance fan experiences in the sports industry.

When I'm not coding, you'll often hear me talking about University of Tennessee athletics, sharing travel stories, and advocating for women's sports.
